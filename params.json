{"name":"Tracy Shi","tagline":"","body":"# Tracy Shi\r\n\r\nThis is a portfolio that introduces projects I have done from school and previous work terms.\r\n\r\n## iOS application: ACM digital library\r\nThis is an iOS app I developed when I was doing co-op at Pivotal Labs. I was paired up with a full time engineer, and together we built this application from scratch. \r\n\r\nIt is a digital library of ACM publications. There are many awesome features such as manage favourite publications, comment/download articles, browse upcoming conferences and save events to calendar. \r\n\r\n## 'Straights' card game\r\nThe Straights card game was built in one of my CS class. It has a complete UI and functionality. It allows two human players or you can play against a computer player!\r\n\r\n## A Timer using Window X\r\nA Timer! =D\r\n\r\n## Window X and Android App: Fruit Slasher\r\nA 'Fruit Slasher' game that mimics Fruit Ninja. Built in UI class. The fruits don't look like fruits yet.. but it's fun to play!\r\n\r\n## Hotel Search Prototype\r\nThis is a hotel search website prototype using Expedia's API. It is a web app built with Sencha Touch framework.\r\n\r\nType in a location in the search box and it will give you a list of hotels in that area, including hotel name, a thumbnail image, address and ratings! Click into one of them will show the hotel on map.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun project I built in my free time.\r\n\r\n## WLPP Compiler\r\nIn a second year CS class, we designed and implemented a WLPP compiler in both C++ and Scheme. WLPP is a programming language that contains a subset of C++.  \r\nI implemented a scanner, a parser, a syntax , code generator based on the language specifications. The compiler was tested against large WLPP programs in school's testing environment, and the efficiency of the generated assembly programs were examined.\r\nConcepts of compiler and MIPS assembly language were applied.\r\n\r\n## Micro-kernel built in OS class\r\nDesigned and implemented a micro-kernel that provides a basic multiprogramming environment,\r\nwith five priority levels, preemption, memory management, message-based inter-process communication, a timing service, system console I/O and debugging support.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
