</a>Inkling Axis App</h2>

<p>I was working on Inkling Axis iOS application when I was doing internship at Inkling. The main feature I created was My Library Search. This Library Search allows users to search across book contents, view search suggestions, browse and filter search results. Offline search was also implemented as well as other key features.
</p>

<p>I also created the matching and image-fillin assessments on Inkling iOS SDK The assessments were created based on the existing consumer app.  </p>

<a name="ios-application-acm-digital-library" class="anchor" href="#ios-application-acm-digital-library"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iOS application: ACM digital library</h2>

<p>This is an iOS app I developed when I was doing co-op at Pivotal Labs. I was paired up with a full time engineer, and together we built this application from scratch. </p>

<p>It is a digital library of ACM publications. There are many awesome features such as manage favourite publications, comment/download articles, browse upcoming conferences and save events to calendar. </p>
