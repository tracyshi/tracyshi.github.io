</a>Easy Planner App</h1>
<p></p>

<h2></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Easy Planner is an application that assists users with day planning and task time esimation using ML algorithms.
We made our way from the intial idea to pitching at the Investor Showcase through the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>We started by conducting market research to identify a product opportunity. </li>
  <li>Then we interviewed 23 potential customers on their time management habits and preferences of digital tools. </li>
  <li>Next we refined our idea based on customer feedback and shaped our business model further.</li>
  <li>In addition, we created a video that vividly demonstrated our product idea.</li>
  <li>Finally, we successfully pitched our Easy Planner product at the Investor Showcase, receiving positive feedback and constructive advice. </li>
</ul>

<h2></a>My Role</h2>
<p>
As the leader and product manager of the project, I was responsible for scheduling meetings, leading discussions,
dividing tasks based on each team member's strengths, clarifying questions with the professors, and making sure we are making good progress and reaching milestones on time.
</p>

<h2></a>Problem Space</h2>

<p>The problem we focused on is Time Management. 

Effective time management is very important yet challenging.
<!-- 
According to a research, 43% of Americans categorize themselves as disorganized.

80% Americans say that they feel stressed throughout the day.

College students are worse. 87% of them struggle with time management. -->

So we wonder, How can we help people better manage their time?  </p>

<p>
As the product manager, below is a roadmap I created that highlights the important milestones of the project.

<h2></a>Product Opportunity Gap</h2>
<p>
Through extensive background research, we identified a product opportunity gap - an AI-powered productivity app that help users plan their days based on their working habits and schedule.
Below is a summary of the current market research.

<h2></a>Customer Interviews and Feedback</h2>
<p>
We interviewed a total of 23 customers with students and freelancers and collected customer needs as shown below.
Next, we refined our idea based on customer feedback, giving up on virtual assistance and incorporated to-do lists as the primary input interface, and shaped our business model further to target students and freelancers.

<h2></a>Product Pricing Model</h2>

<h2></a>Stakeholders & Value Flow</h2>
<p>
Our main user groups are students and freelancers.
Looking ahead, we seek to build relationships with large corporations like universities and freelancer platform.

The organizations will purchase easy planner for their members, so they are better performed, happier, and healthier.

The organizations would also purchase customer data to understand how much time each task takes.
