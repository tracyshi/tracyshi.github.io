<a name="ios-application-acm-digital-library" class="anchor" href="#ios-application-acm-digital-library"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iOS application: ACM digital library</h2>

<p>This is an iOS app I developed when I was doing co-op at Pivotal Labs. I was paired up with a full time engineer, and together we built this application from scratch. </p>

<p>It is a digital library of ACM publications. There are many awesome features such as manage favourite publications, comment/download articles, browse upcoming conferences and save events to calendar. </p>

<a name="straights-card-game" class="anchor" href="#straights-card-game"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>'Straights' card game</h2>

<p>The Straights card game was built in one of my CS class. It has a complete UI and functionality. It allows two human players or you can play against a computer player!</p>

<p>A 'Fruit Slasher' game that mimics Fruit Ninja. Built in UI class. The fruits don't look like fruits yet.. but it's fun to play!</p>

<h2>
<a name="hotel-search-prototype" class="anchor" href="#hotel-search-prototype"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hotel Search Prototype</h2>

<p>This is a hotel search website prototype using Expedia's API. It is a web app built with Sencha Touch framework.</p>

<p>Type in a location in the search box and it will give you a list of hotels in that area, including hotel name, a thumbnail image, address and ratings! Click into one of them will show the hotel on map.</p>

<p>It's a fun project I built in my free time.</p>

<h2>
<a name="wlpp-compiler" class="anchor" href="#wlpp-compiler"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WLPP Compiler</h2>

<p>In a second year CS class, we designed and implemented a WLPP compiler in both C++ and Scheme. WLPP is a programming language that contains a subset of C++.<br>
I implemented a scanner, a parser, a syntax , code generator based on the language specifications. The compiler was tested against large WLPP programs in school's testing environment, and the efficiency of the generated assembly programs were examined.
Concepts of compiler and MIPS assembly language were applied.</p>

<h2>
<a name="micro-kernel-built-in-os-class" class="anchor" href="#micro-kernel-built-in-os-class"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Micro-kernel built in OS class</h2>

<p>Designed and implemented a micro-kernel that provides a basic multiprogramming environment,
with five priority levels, preemption, memory management, message-based inter-process communication, a timing service, system console I/O and debugging support.</p>
